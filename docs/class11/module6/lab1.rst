Install the TCP iApp
--------------------

On Big-IP1, iApps => Templates => [Browse...] => \\This PC \\Downloads\\iApps\\f5.tcp.v1.0.0rc5\\f5.tcp.v1.0.0rc5.tmpl => [Open]. Click [Upload].

.. image:: ./images/1_f5_tcp_iapp1.png
  :scale: 50%

Confirm the iApp template upload was successful.
iApps => Templates => "Show All" in the lower right hand corner.
Locate the f5.tcp... iApp template at the bottom.

Note the Secondary IP addresses assigned to Big-IP1 and Big-IP2
---------------------------------------------------------------

In order to configure the TCP iApp we'll need to record the Secondary private IPs of both Big-IP1 and Big-IP2.
From the AWS Console, Services => EC2 => INSTANCES => Instances => **Big-IP1**. Select the [Description] tab below. Copy the Secondary private IP and paste in Notepad. We'll refer to this shortly.

From the AWS Console, Services => EC2 => INSTANCES => Instances => **Big-IP2**. Select the [Description] tab below. Copy the Secondary private IP and paste in Notepad. We'll refer to this shortly.

Create a High Availability Virtual Server with the TCP iApp
-----------------------------------------------------------

From Big-IP1, iApps => Application Services => Create a new iApp.

  Name: example01

  Template: f5.tcp.v1.0.0rc5.tmpl

.. image:: ./images/4_f5_tcp_iapp4.png
  :scale: 50%

Fill in the iApp template parameters. Leave defaults where not explicitly called out below.

From the AWS Console, Services => EC2 => NETWORK & SECURITY => Elastic IPs.
Note the Elastic IP address (public IPv4 address) mapping for the Secondary IP address of our **Active** Big-IP1 (10.0.1.x).

From the Visual Studio Code Terminal, invoke `terraform output`.

.. code-block:: bash

   terraform output | grep Bigip1VipEipAddress

...Ctrl + click on the *Bigip1VipEipAddress=*. This is the same Elastic IP we just reviewed in the AWS Console.

Survive a fail-over event across Availability Zones
---------------------------------------------------

From the AWS Console, Services => EC2 => NETWORK & SECURITY => Elastic IPs.
Note the Elastic IP address (public IPv4 address) mapping for the Secondary IP address of our **Active** Big-IP1 (10.0.1.x).

From the AWS Console, Services => EC2 => NETWORK & SECURITY => Elastic IPs.
Note the Elastic IP address (public IPv4 address) mapping for the Secondary IP has changed to the new **Active** Big-IP2 (10.0.2.x).
Hit the refresh icon in the upper-right-hand side a few times until you notice the change.

.. attention::

  The example application reports which Availability Zone is serving up the content (pool member), *not* which Availability Zone is hosting the active Big-IP.
